# Airline Passenger Satisfaction – Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether an airline passenger is satisfied based on survey data.

The goal of the project is to practice clean data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using a simple and interpretable model.

## Dataset
The Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset is publicly available.
The dataset is not included in this repository.

Instructions for obtaining the dataset can be found in the `data/` folder.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Polynomial feature interactions to capture non-linear relationships
- Logistic Regression with regularization

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter notebook

## Notes
This project was built for learning and experimentation.
